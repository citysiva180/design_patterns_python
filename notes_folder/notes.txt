#  Singleton Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class 
has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
In other words, it restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance 
and provides a way to access that instance from any part of the code.

- Breaks single Responsibility 
- Testability issues 
- State for life

#  Factory Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

"The Factory Method is a design pattern that defines an interface for creating 
objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate."

In other words, the Factory Method pattern provides a way to create objects by 
delegating the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses. This promotes flexibility 
and allows different subclasses to create different types of objects while adhering to 
a common interface

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Abstract Factory Pattern!   |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Abstract Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating
families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It 
allows you to create objects that are related by a common theme or concept, such as creating 
different types of products in a system.


#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Builder Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

"The Builder Pattern is a design pattern that separates the construction of a 
complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to 
create different representations."

In other words, the Builder Pattern provides a way to construct complex objects 
step by step, enabling you to create different variations of the object by using 
the same construction process. It promotes flexibility, reusability, and separation 
of concerns in object creation.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Prototype Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create 
new objects by copying an existing instance, known as the prototype. It helps in 
creating new objects with the same state as an existing object, avoiding the need 
to explicitly define and initialize every attribute and property.

An analogy for the Prototype Pattern is a photocopying machine. Imagine you have an 
original document, and you want to create multiple copies of it. Instead of rewriting 
the entire content for each copy, you can use a photocopying machine to duplicate the 
original. Similarly, the Prototype Pattern allows you to create new objects by cloning 
an existing object, which serves as the prototype.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Adapter Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible 
interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, 
making them compatible and enabling them to collaborate without changing their existing 
code.

An analogy for the Adapter Pattern is a power adapter. Consider that you have a device 
with a plug designed for one type of electrical outlet, but you're in a region with a 
different type of outlet. You use a power adapter to bridge the gap and connect your 
device to the foreign outlet. Similarly, the Adapter Pattern allows objects with different 
interfaces to communicate and interact seamlessly.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Bridge Pattern!    |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

Certainly! The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates abstraction 
from implementation. It allows you to create a bridge between two orthogonal (independent) 
abstractions, enabling them to vary independently. This pattern is especially useful when 
you have multiple dimensions of variability that need to be managed independently.

An analogy for the Bridge Pattern is a TV remote control. The remote control acts as a 
bridge between the user and the TV. Regardless of the TV's brand or model, the user can 
change channels, adjust the volume, and perform other actions using the remote control.
The bridge pattern similarly allows you to decouple abstractions (e.g., user actions) 
from their implementations (e.g., TV models).

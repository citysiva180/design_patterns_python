#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Singleton Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class 
has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
In other words, it restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance 
and provides a way to access that instance from any part of the code.

- Breaks single Responsibility 
- Testability issues 
- State for life

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Factory Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

"The Factory Method is a design pattern that defines an interface for creating 
objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate."

In other words, the Factory Method pattern provides a way to create objects by 
delegating the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses. This promotes flexibility 
and allows different subclasses to create different types of objects while adhering to 
a common interface

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Abstract Factory Pattern!   |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Abstract Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating
families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It 
allows you to create objects that are related by a common theme or concept, such as creating 
different types of products in a system.


#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Builder Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

"The Builder Pattern is a design pattern that separates the construction of a 
complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to 
create different representations."

In other words, the Builder Pattern provides a way to construct complex objects 
step by step, enabling you to create different variations of the object by using 
the same construction process. It promotes flexibility, reusability, and separation 
of concerns in object creation.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Prototype Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create 
new objects by copying an existing instance, known as the prototype. It helps in 
creating new objects with the same state as an existing object, avoiding the need 
to explicitly define and initialize every attribute and property.

An analogy for the Prototype Pattern is a photocopying machine. Imagine you have an 
original document, and you want to create multiple copies of it. Instead of rewriting 
the entire content for each copy, you can use a photocopying machine to duplicate the 
original. Similarly, the Prototype Pattern allows you to create new objects by cloning 
an existing object, which serves as the prototype.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Adapter Pattern!   |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible 
interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, 
making them compatible and enabling them to collaborate without changing their existing 
code.

An analogy for the Adapter Pattern is a power adapter. Consider that you have a device 
with a plug designed for one type of electrical outlet, but you're in a region with a 
different type of outlet. You use a power adapter to bridge the gap and connect your 
device to the foreign outlet. Similarly, the Adapter Pattern allows objects with different 
interfaces to communicate and interact seamlessly.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Bridge Pattern!    |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

Certainly! The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates abstraction 
from implementation. It allows you to create a bridge between two orthogonal (independent) 
abstractions, enabling them to vary independently. This pattern is especially useful when 
you have multiple dimensions of variability that need to be managed independently.

An analogy for the Bridge Pattern is a TV remote control. The remote control acts as a 
bridge between the user and the TV. Regardless of the TV's brand or model, the user can 
change channels, adjust the volume, and perform other actions using the remote control.
The bridge pattern similarly allows you to decouple abstractions (e.g., user actions) 
from their implementations (e.g., TV models).

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
# Composite Pattern!  |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects 
into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat 
individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

An analogy for the Composite Pattern is a computer file system. In a file system, a 
directory can contain files and subdirectories, which can, in turn, contain more files and 
subdirectories. You can perform operations like copying, moving, or deleting on both 
individual files and entire directories. The Composite Pattern similarly allows you 
to treat individual objects and compositions (combinations) of objects uniformly.

Here's how the Composite Pattern works:

Component: 

    This is the base interface or abstract class that declares common operations 
    for both leaf and composite objects. It defines methods that can be used uniformly 
    across all objects in the hierarchy.

Leaf: 
    
    These are the individual objects that don't have any children. They implement the 
    methods declared in the component interface. In a file system example, 
    files are leaf objects.

Composite: 
    
    These are objects that can have children, which can be either leaves or other 
    composites. Composites implement the component interface as well as methods for 
    adding, removing, and accessing children.

Its more like a company where all people are employees but you have manager, vp and senior vp 
etc 

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
# Decorator Pattern!  |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

Certainly! The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add 
new behaviors or responsibilities to objects without altering their existing code. It is 
often used to extend the functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.

An analogy for the Decorator Pattern is decorating a room. Imagine you have a plain 
room, and you want to add decorations like paintings, curtains, and furniture. You can 
add or remove these decorations without changing the structure of the room itself. Similarly, 
the Decorator Pattern allows you to add new features or responsibilities to objects without 
modifying their core functionality.

Here's how the Decorator Pattern works:

Component: 

    This is the base interface or abstract class that defines the common methods 
    for all concrete components.

Concrete Component: 

    This is the base class that implements the component interface. It represents the 
    core object to which you want to add functionalities.

Decorator: 

    This is the abstract class that also implements the component interface. It has 
    a reference to a component and can dynamically add or override its behaviors.

Concrete Decorator: 
    
    These are the concrete classes that extend the decorator. They add specific 
    behaviors or responsibilities to the component.

#+++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Facade Pattern!    |
#+++++++++++++++++++++#

Certainly! The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified 
and unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It simplifies complex systems 
by providing a higher-level interface that clients can use to interact with the system, rather 
than having clients interact directly with multiple subsystem components. This pattern is 
often used to hide the complexities and intricacies of a system and provide a more 
user-friendly interface.

Analogy: 

    Think of a facade as the user interface of a modern smartphone. A smartphone is a 
complex device with numerous hardware and software components such as processors, memory, 
sensors, and various apps. However, users interact with the phone primarily through a 
simplified, user-friendly interface – the touchscreen, icons, and menus. This interface 
shields users from the underlying complexity of the device and its software.


Here's how the Facade Pattern works:

Facade: 

    This is a class that provides a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem 
or set of classes. It encapsulates the details of how the subsystem works.

Subsystems: 
    
    These are the individual classes or components that make up the complex system. 
Clients typically interact with these subsystem classes through the facade

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Flyweight Design Pattern! |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to minimize 
memory or computational costs associated with creating and managing a large number of 
objects with similar properties. It does this by sharing as much as possible between 
these objects, thereby reducing memory usage and improving performance.

#++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Proxy Design Pattern! |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++#

Proxy pattern provides a substitute for another object and controls 
access to that object, allowing you to perform something before 
or after the request reaches the original object 

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern! |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an 
object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain decides either 
to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples 
senders and receivers of requests and allows multiple objects to handle a request without the 
sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Command Design Pattern! |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Command Design Pattern helps in decoupling object requests from client. 
The command Design pattern implements a command class which actually handles all requests. 
If requests are directly sent to invoke their respective function there is a tight coupling 
by which too many requests would be sent to back end. To handle this we have a command option 
where it handles the requests by a queue which is then processed one by one by the back end code 

Advantages of Command Design Pattern 

- A Request is wrapped in an object that contains all request info 
- The command Object is passed to the correct handler 
- Decoupling 
- Efficiency, Ordering, Priority etc 

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Interpreter Design Pattern! |
#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

Interpreter Design Pattern deals with processing expressions which are terminal and non terminal. 
Meaning, it deals with a complex calculation in a certain recursive sequence by which it evaluates 
heavy loads. In this approach it is identified that terminal expressions are the operators and the 
non-terminal expressions are the operands 

Concepts of Interpreter Pattern 

- Recursively evaluate grammar expressions 
- Parsing, Processing Engines etc 
- Important Components are  
    - Terminal Expression 
    - Non-Terminal Expression 

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Iterator Design Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

Iterator Traverses through a collection. Meaning its a glorified loop which works 
on classes and functions. Iterator consists of classes which reverses and sorts an elements. 
The Idea of an iterator pattern is to traverse, meaning loop through individual elements in a 
sequential way. The reason this pattern is chosen instead of a traditional loop is this pattern 
stays unrelated to any collections elements. So basically a binary tree is implemented by 
which speed in traverse is achieved.

The Iterator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access 
elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 
It defines a separate object, called an iterator, which encapsulates the traversal of the 
elements of the aggregate.

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Mediator Design Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

This pattern is some what similar to command pattern. however there is no queue involved 

- Provide a central object used for communicating between objects 
- Objects don't talk to each other 
- Reduce Dependency between Object 

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Observer Design Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of 
dependents, known as observers, that are notified of any changes in the subject's state. This pattern is commonly 
used to implement distributed event handling systems.

Key Participants:

Subject: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to attach, detach, and notify observers of state changes.
Observer: Defines an interface for receiving updates from the subject.
ConcreteSubject: Implements the Subject interface and maintains the state that observers are interested in. 
It notifies observers of changes in its state.
ConcreteObserver: Implements the Observer interface and registers with the subject to receive updates.

- Define a subscription mechanism 
- Notify multiple objects simultaneously 
- One to Many Relationships 

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  State Design Pattern!    |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter 
its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern represents states as separate 
classes and delegates the state-specific behavior to these classes. This makes it easy to
add new states and transitions between states without modifying the context (the object whose behavior varies with
its internal state).

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#
#  Strategy Design Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++#

 The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, 
 and makes them interchangeable. It lets the client code vary its behavior without changing its structure. The pattern 
 defines a set of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++#
# Visitor Design Pattern! |
#+++++++++++++++++++++++++#

The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a new operation without 
changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. It is often used when you have a set of related classes that 
represent a hierarchy of objects, and you want to perform operations on these objects that are not part of their common interface.

Key Participants:

Visitor: 

    Defines a Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement in the object structure. 
    The Visit operation signature typically includes the type of ConcreteElement being visited.

ConcreteVisitor: 
    
    Implements the Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement. 
    This class is responsible for the actual processing or manipulation of the elements.

Element: 

    Declares an Accept operation that accepts a visitor. 
    This operation is the entry point for the visitor to access the element.

ConcreteElement: 

    Implements the Accept operation. This operation typically calls the 
    Visit method on the visitor, passing itself as an argument.

ObjectStructure: 

    Represents a collection or structure of elements that need to be visited. 
    It provides an interface to allow visitors to visit its elements.
